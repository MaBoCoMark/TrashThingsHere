Drinking culture in China is omnipresent in the daily life, during the dinners at home with friends or family, celebrations, holidays, nights out on the town, and especially business meeting. Drinking culture in China is quite different from the drinking culture in the western countries. As  Chinese, it is important to know the rules of Chinese drinking etiquette.

Drinking in China is an pervasive social ritual. Toasting is a very important on-going ritual in China and it happens very regularly especially at a formal banquet; the honoured guest returns the toast to the host, the host or the eldest person is expected to make the first toast.
When we toast together, the person of a lower status should have the glass slightly lower than the other person.
When someone said “Ganbei” which literally means “dry the glass”, you’d better empty your glass, or be branded as a disrespectful person.

Sometimes you would like to impress your hosts, remember to hold your glass in both hands when offering the toast. When you offering the toast, you’re putting yourself in an inferior position, which means you have to be the more respectful one. Thus, it’s better if you stand up and empty your cup completely. The other person may remain seated and drink just a bit, but usually they will go out of their way to show you the same respect as just good manners.

During business lunches, most of the time we toast with a glass of Baijiu that is said to bring luck. Baijiu is one of the most popular drinks in China, and it is the drink of choice for business dinners.
Baijiu is a traditional fermented alcoholic drink originating in China, normally made from barley, corn, rice, wheat and sorghum. The most popular kind of Baijiu in China is Baijiu have high alcohol content and is enjoyed during family celebrations, business negotiations, holidays, and is offered when a foreign guest is present. Baijiu over 50 degrees represents 80% of sales in China, following a belief of high-quality associated with high-degree of alcohol. 
In China, drinking Baijiu is usually done when toasting with another person and nether alone.


Nowadays, More and more Chinese are becoming more health conscious, and therefore, start to reduce their consumption of the traditional Baijiu, viewed as bad for health.
While still a significant part of the drinking occasion are following traditional context and rules, in recent years, drinking in China has shifting to more purpose of experiencing culture, cultivating friendship, relaxing, and having fun.
