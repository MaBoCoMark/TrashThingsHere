Drinking culture in China is omnipresent in the daily life, during the dinners at home with friends or family, celebrations, holidays, nights out on the town, and especially business meeting. Drinking culture in China is quite different from the drinking culture in the western countries. As  Chinese, it is important to know the rules of Chinese drinking etiquette.

Drinking in China is an pervasive social ritual. Toasting is a very important on-going ritual in China and it happens very regularly especially at a formal banquet; the honoured guest returns the toast to the host, the host or the eldest person is expected to make the first toast.
When we toast together, the person of a lower status should have the glass slightly lower than the other person.
When someone said “Ganbei” which literally means “dry the glass”, you’d better empty your glass, or be branded as a disrespectful person.

Sometimes you would like to impress your hosts, remember to hold your glass in both hands when offering the toast. When you offering the toast, you’re putting yourself in an inferior position, which means you have to be the more respectful one. Thus, it’s better if you stand up and empty your cup completely. The other person may remain seated and drink just a bit, but usually they will go out of their way to show you the same respect as just good manners.

During business lunches, most of the time we toast with a glass of Baijiu that is said to bring luck. Baijiu is one of the most popular drinks in China, and it is the drink of choice for business dinners.
Baijiu is a traditional fermented alcoholic drink originating in China, normally made from barley, corn, rice, wheat and sorghum. The most popular kind of Baijiu in China is Baijiu have high alcohol content and is enjoyed during family celebrations, business negotiations, holidays, and is offered when a foreign guest is present. Baijiu over 50 degrees represents 80% of sales in China, following a belief of high-quality associated with high-degree of alcohol. 
In China, drinking Baijiu is usually done when toasting with another person and nether alone.


Nowadays, More and more Chinese are becoming more health conscious, and therefore, start to reduce their consumption of the traditional Baijiu, viewed as bad for health.
While still a significant part of the drinking occasion are following traditional context and rules, in recent years, drinking in China has shifting to more purpose of experiencing culture, cultivating friendship, relaxing, and having fun.

Drinking in China is an elaborate art with protocols that originated thousands of years ago. The drinking culture in China is omnipresent in daily life, during the dinners at home with friends or family, celebrations, holidays, casual get together, and most importantly business meetings.

Drinking in China is an pervasive social ritual. Toasting is a very important on-going ritual in China and it happens very regularly especially at a formal banquet. As Chinese, it is important to know how to toast during these events mentioned above.

There are mainly four reasons why people make toast during formal banquet: the welcoming toast, the eldest person’s toast, one-by-one toast, and punishment toast. The welcoming toast usually hosted by the host. As a guest,  you must avoid getting in the way of the preliminary toast. As the eldest person’s toast, the eldest person always be branded as the most respectful one in the whole family. Especially in elders’ birthday celebrations, their toast will bring luck and long life to all guests. One-by-one toast usually happened during family banquet, just easily start to toast one by one clockwise or counter-clockwise according to everyone’s position on the table. Punishment toast often happens if someone is late to the party, a normal punishment for latecomers allows them to catch up to the rest of the people at the party.

It is important to know the basic manner of toasting. While others offering the toast, the person of a lower status should have the glass slightly lower than the other person. It is considered extremely rude to refuse a drink when someone toasts you. The amount you drink when someone toasts you is tied to the amount of respect you are showing them. Of course, “drying your glass” is considered the biggest respect at the table.

While you offering the toast, you’re putting yourself in an inferior position, which means you have to be the more respectful one. Sometimes you would like to impress your hosts or any others, remember to hold your glass in both hands when offering the toast. It’s better if you stand up and empty your cup completely. If you choose to toast someone who is older than you or holds a status higher than you, ensure you hold your glass slightly lower than usual as you ‘clink’. While toasting, you are supposed to say some words to express gratitude, or to connect friends or to show anticipation for future deals. The other person may remain seated and drink just a bit, but usually they will go out of their way to show you the same respect as just good manners.

Toasting is a significant part of the drinking occasion which is following traditional context and rules. While Many Chinese believe that drinking is essential for career development, it is important for us to know the rules of Chinese drinking etiquette.
